# BMaude
BMaude is a verification tool for B specifications written in the Abstract Machine Notation. The tool is implemented in the [Maude](http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu) language, by Christiano Braga (<http://www.ic.uff.br/~cbraga>).

## System requirements
* This version of BMaude requires Maude Alpha 115.
* [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com) on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/br/macos/) produces a nicer experience.

## Installing the tool

## Running the tool
